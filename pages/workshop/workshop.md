# Workshop on Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging: Diagnostic and Prognostic Perspectives

This workshop will feature research on the use of artificial intelligence for computerized or computer-assisted diagnosis and prognosis from medical images, focusing on but not limited to histopathology and radiology. Submissions from human, veterinary, and comparative medicine are welcome. Original articles with full papers on unpublished work will be presented as longer talks and scientific spotlights with abstracts on previously published work will be presented as shorter talks.
